Thank you for playing the game Duku's Underground!

This game took a lot of effort and time!

I mean not too much time, but long enough to get you to play a 5 minute game. 

Mistakes were made.

Laughs were had.

Tears were not shed because whatever problem was had a solution came to fruition!

The people at the Public Library would like to thank you for taking the time and learning some basic programming skills.

I want to thank mom, dad, brother, sister, and cousin Tony.

Tell you friends!!
